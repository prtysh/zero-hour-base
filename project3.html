            <p><strong>COLIN FRANK &amp; SINEAD KERR (GROUP 3)</strong></p>
            <p><em>Bios:</em></p>
            <p><em>COLIN FRANK</em></p>
            <p>Originally from Ottawa (CAN), Colin Frank experiments with sound, electronics, theatre, installation art,
                and percussion; investigating excess, bodily extremes, barely controllable instruments, and rich raw
                noises. His PhD research at the University of Huddersfield (UK) considers unconventional instruments and
                objects as active agents in the creative process. His duo Brutalust explores intermedia performance to
                engage audiences in novel ways, and his group the Drift Ensemble mixes experimental improvisation with
                contemporary composition.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Active on international stages, he has most notably performed in the Huddersfield Contemporary Music
                Festival (UK), Berlin&rsquo;s CTM festival (DE), the Darmstadt Internationale Ferienkurse f&uuml;r Neue
                Musik (DE), Electric Springs (UK), Beast Feast (UK), SoundThought (UK), PAS Quebec Days (CAN), and the
                Oorsprong curators series (NL). His instrumental compositions have been presented by the Moscow
                Contemporary Music Ensemble (RU), TAK Ensemble (US), AndPlay duo (US), Red Note Ensemble (UK), and many
                solo collaborators. Recently, in the Mixed Currents project, violin performance, virtuosity, and beauty
                were explored in a collaborative environment. In his installation works, audiences are encouraged to
                interact with common objects, and his concern about plastic waste has prompted critical commentary on
                consumptive habits.</p>
            <p>Colin received a double-degree B.Mus in composition and performance from McGill University. He studied
                sound at the Institute of Sonology (NL), composition at the Internationale Ferienkurse f&uuml;r Neue
                Musik and SoundSCAPE (IT), and performance at Nief-Norf Summer Festival (US) and SICPP (US). He has
                taught improvisation at the Waterloo Region Contemporary Music Festival (CAN) and at Huddersfield
                University.</p>

            <p><em>SINEAD KERR</em></p>
            <p>An Irish multimedia artist practicing in Leicester, England. She is interested in virtual and concrete
                space with the complexity of hindrance and negotiation within a space that affects an artistic practice.
                With influences from Constructivism, Dadaism, the contextual readings of &lsquo;The Poetics of
                space&rsquo; (Gaston bachelor 1994) and &lsquo;The Production of Space&rsquo; (Henri Lefebvre 1984) in
                relation to &ldquo;Art and Objecthood&rdquo; (Micheal Fried 1967).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Kerr&rsquo;s work is influenced by her actions of making, constructing and realisation of artwork in a
                studio or showing space. Collage is the foundation of her ideas that she works back into the space,
                which then develops into installation or film or both combined, when combined these 2 approaches create
                a dialogue with many questions that also creates an engagement/vocal point for the viewer.</p>
            <p>Kerr graduated from De Montfort University in July of 2019 with a BA first Class Honours in fine art with
                a graduate award under her belt that allowed her to exhibit her work in Two Queens gallery/ studio in
                Leicester. In January of 2020 she was the recipient of ArtCore&rsquo;s, Graduate residency programme in
                Derby with an exhibition that was showcased in February. With further plans of a solo exhibition in
                Northern Ireland but unfortunately was postponed due to covid-19. Participating in artist takeovers and
                artists talks throughout social media platforms. With an instagram exhibition in the pipeworks with
                Making space the date which is unknown.</p>
            <p><em>Residency:</em></p>
            <p><strong>The challenge of geographical location, communication and the virtual.</strong></p>
            <p>We are continually in a process of learning. Practices and knowledge emerge and transform as we make our
                way through life. In this project, we focused on developing our understanding of the spaces around us.
                To reimagine and learn about those spaces, we experimented, dreamed, tested, and made. This playing with
                space - those of our physical homes, the Internet-space, and spaces of technology - meant we could
                change our attention. We could refocus our gaze on peculiarities, and imagine new possibilities for
                those spaces. The resulting artwork presents contradictions and compliments within a space and between
                multiple spaces. It transforms the available viewing space, turning a particular space into a new
                surrounding. These spatial augmentations changed our understanding of spaces, and allowed us to develop
                practices previously unbeknownst to us.</p>
            <p><br /><br /></p>
            <p>Sinead: creating art for her is quite physical through the practice of art, space and object. While
                location is important it&rsquo;s also working with spatial awareness and artistic intuition. Coming up
                with a concept is just something that comes with inspiration and bouncing words and ideas off each
                other. But bringing the ideas to life through technology is a challenge that she faces during the
                process. The art of communication is key; keeping in contact a must. Something that has come up
                throughout this residency is that &lsquo;you communicate what you visualise, while your collaborator
                might hear what you say, they don't fully see what you mean&rsquo;. The result can therefore be
                unexpected. Saying this, throughout this residency the collaborative process has been portrayed through
                conversations and sharing work which has been a breath of fresh air. Working in a completely different
                way previous to covid-19 has given a new perspective on the process for her. Using new softwares like
                sketchup, blender and colour director is new to her. She wanted to challenge herself to further her
                capabilities, and push the boundaries on what could be achieved in this residency. They both used
                techniques that brought this collaboration to life, such as green screening, matte generation and
                keying. These tools allowed them to have each other&rsquo;s spaces together, to form a new hybrid space,
                and create a new environment that does not exist.</p>
            <p>Colin: The residency has been an interesting experiment in long-distance collaboration cross-discipline,
                and, especially due to the April/May UK lockdown restrictions under which this residency occured, the
                limitation on space and movement has influenced my approach. Through discussions with Sinead about
                disorientating space, mixing locations, and creating alternative perspectives on the direct surroundings
                one finds themself in, I began reimagining my own house. Through experimenting with the video camera
                &mdash; indeed, considering it as a performative tool &mdash; I explored the little noticed, disregarded
                alcoves around me. As they collected images, performances, and footage, gradually I found myself
                constructing a strange living space. Partly my house, partly Sinead&rsquo;s, an unreal connection formed
                in Internet-space. This, to me, epitomizes the residency: all the discussions on Zoom, performance
                videos being compiled in a shared folder, and their WhatsApp chat about art &mdash; these facets formed
                a place unto itself. A sort of Internet hyperreal space emerged, much like the art they are working on,
                where creativeness, exploration, contemplation, and inquisitiveness could coexist.</p>
            <p><em>Concept:&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p><strong>In search of familiarity: A manufactured perception</strong></p>
            <p>How can we reimagine the spaces we live in, especially when the confines of quarantine force us to be in
                them for above average time? Can the spaces we live in be perceptually distorted, such that our daily
                experience of them becomes a mixture of the familiar and strange?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Space, for us, is about reflection and explanation. It is for experimentation, which is essential to
                process and produce original and aesthetic products. The materiality of spaces are partly active and
                ever-changing evidence, traces and archives that allow insights into creative individuals&rsquo; work,
                creativity and methodologies. The medium is the style of expression or communication through the
                artwork, and the space used by the artist to construct the concept. Although copies of expanding ideas,
                these works may not exist in physical form, they are meant to be appreciated for their emotional,
                physical manifestation through an interactive medium. Our point and work shows ideas and methodologies
                through different mediums, and adapts to the here and now.</p>
            <p>Over the course of our collaboration we investigated the indoor nooks and crevices of our houses through
                performance, recording, augmentation, and combination. We performed with found objects, supplanting
                their normative functionality by experimental utility; we captured videos and images, collaging them to
                fold spaces within other spaces; and we drew floor plans of unreal, hypothetical buildings. While
                gathering and developing, we digitally combined our respective locked-in spaces to form new spaces;
                hyperreal and impossible locations. These new spaces emerged from our present realities, allowing us to
                view our surroundings in fresh ways. The resulting raw and at times humorous material provides a
                passageway into the depths of radiators, the interiors of cupboards, or the hidden undersides of
                ventilators.</p>
            <p>When talking about the viewer, whether it be observant or interactive, there are many opinions to learn
                from the viewer; The viewer's role is vital and central in the way of interpretation &mdash; giving the
                art a purpose by manipulating certain aspects of said works &mdash; opening an alternative concept in
                notion with the traditional analytical description. This aspect may be different to what we first
                intended, bringing different questions and opinions to light showing that there are many views to
                consider with viewing specific artworks. Especially in the space that the work is situated and how this
                contributes to the work seen, reading into &lsquo;the production of space&rsquo; there is this
                relationship between the familiar and the difference between the beliefs and opinions.</p>
            <p>In presenting this interactive online experience to you, we hope you can reimagine your own space. We
                encourage you to reconsider the possibilities of where you are living, and contemplate as to what
                alternative worlds could exist in the crevices of your own home.</p>

            <p><em>About Zero Hour:</em></p>
            <p>Zero Hour E-Residency began as a response to the March 2020 lockdown procedures put in place during the
                COVID-19 pandemic. Suddenly creative spaces around the world were shut down and people were confined to
                their houses. Instead of focusing on the negatives, the team at We Belong Here decided to use this time
                to start a global conversation, an online residency which could not be possible conventionally. 5 visual
                and 6 performance artists from all across the world, came together to foster a sense of community and
                cross-arts collaboration. Over 4 weeks the artists were paired up and worked together to create a body
                of work reflecting upon the theme of Zero Hour. In this present climate, our future is fluid and time is
                relative. Zero Hour outlines the idea of how we begin again. As artists and as a collective whole, it
                lies in our hands to rewrite the shape of our future, making sure we create a new precedent that we can
                all be proud of. This E-residency has strived to create a space wherein you can find answers to these
                questions and be the architects of this new future.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>About We Belong Here:</em></p>
            <p>We Belong Here is a pioneering movement led by the creative community for the community. Co-founded by
                Natasha Joseph, Lucy Teoh &amp; Francesca Rodi, it is about experimenting with the crucial themes of
                today, exposing society to expression and collective sharing and always celebrating creativity and
                diversity. We Belong Here, based in Leeds, England, creates opportunities for these ideas to be
                catalysed by providing events that engage every kind of creative and give them a platform to exhibit,
                perform and express. We believe our community provides the building blocks of change. By supporting and
                nurturing them we create new generations of artists and artistry. We Belong Here stands by expression
                across art forms, be it artist, poets, dramatists, musicians or dancers, across age groups and across
                communities, building contemporary spaces where they may all exist in unison.</p>
